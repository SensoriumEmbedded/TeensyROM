## TeensyROM Feature Details
### Compatable with C64 and C128 machines/variants, NTSC and PAL supported
### **Super fast Loading (.PRG/P00) or ROM emulation (.CRT)** directly from:
  * USB thumb Drive
  * SD card
  * Teensy Internal Flash Memory
  * Transfer directly from PC using the [TeensyROM UI](https://github.com/MetalHexx/TeensyROM-UI)
  * See supported file details [here](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/General_Usage.md#loading-programs-and-emulating-roms)
  * [NFC Loading system](docs/NFC_Loader.md) available to quickly select/load with NFC tags.
### **MIDI in/out via USB Host connection:** 
  * Play your SID with a USB MIDI keyboard!
  * Use with popular software such as **Cynthcart, Station64** etc, or the included MIDI2SID app
  * Supports all regular MIDI messages **in and out**
    * Can use your C64 to play a MIDI sound capable device.
  * **Sequential, Datel/Siel, Passport/Sentech, and Namesoft** MIDI cartridges emulated 
  * Use a USB Hub for multiple instruments+thumb drive access
### **MIDI in via USB Device connection:** 
  * Stream .SID or .MIDI files from a modern computer directly to your Commodore machine SID chip!
  * Play MIDI files out of your PC into C64 apps such as Cynthcart or the MIDI2SID app
  * Stream .SID files out of your PC using the ASID MIDI protocol to hear any SID file on original hardware.
### **Internet communication via Ethernet connection**
  * Connect to your favorite C64/128 Telnet BBS!
  * Use with released software such as **CCGMS, StrikeTerm2014, DesTerm128,** etc

## Compatibility
* TeensyROM compatability has been fully validated on **many** different NTSC **and** PAL machines: C64, C64C, SX-64, and C128 as well as modern reproductions such as EVO64, Mega65 (r5 and higher), Ultimate 64, and Reloaded MKII
* The early "prototype" version of breadbin (PCA 326298 w/ 5 pin video) has a known issue with the reset circuit that must be corrected to be compatible with the TeensyROM and other fastload cartridges. See [this post](https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=74222) or [this video](https://youtu.be/agDFLPP9yIw?t=813) for instructions on how to correct this issue.

## Hardware-PCB Design
Component selection was done using parts large enough (SOIC and 0805s at the smallest) that any soldering enthusiast should be able to assemble themselves.   Since high volume production isn't necessarily the vision for this device, 2 sided SMT was used to reduce the PCB size while still accommodating larger IC packages.

**A note about overclocking**
The Teensy 4.1 is slightly "overclocked" to 816MHz from FW in this design. Per the app, external cooling is not required for this speed.  However, in abundance of caution, a heatsink is specified in the BOM for this project.  In addition, the temperature can be read on the setup screen of the main TeensyROM app. The max spec is 95C, and there is a panic shutdown at 90C.  In my experience, even on a warm day running for hours with no heatsink, the temp doesn't excede 75C.
