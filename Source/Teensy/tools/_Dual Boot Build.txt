*** How to make the Dual Boot hex file:
   Prep: edit "Set Upper.bat" & "Set Original.bat" to point LocalPath to your AppData\Local path

1. Run "Set Upper.bat" to set linker to build at upper Teensy memory
2. Run Arduino and build main TeensyROM code to hex file, close Arduino
    Be sure to select "Serial+MIDI" USB Type
3. Run "Set Original.bat" to set linker to build at normal/base location
4. Run Arduino and compile MinimalBoot code
    Be sure to select "Serial" (only) USB Type
5. Combine .hex files:
       run CombineImages.bat and verify output: dates/build locations of each .hex file 
     -or-
       run build-helper.sh script
     -or-
       a. start with lower/minimal hex file
       b. delete last 2 lines
       c. copy paste in all of upper/main hex file
       d. Change last 2 lines to this: (startup address and end of file indicator)
         :040000056000100087   (start address = lower)
         :00000001FF           (EOF)
