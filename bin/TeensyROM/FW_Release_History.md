# FW Release Version history:

### 0.6.7 Release 2025/06/14
* Note: EEPROM settings will be reset with this FW version (color settings added)
* TeensyROM UI Customizable color scheme
  * Color setting page addition/features:
    * 'C' (capital C) from any Directory Menu to enter page
    * Choose any of the 16 available colors for 7 different color parameters.
    * 6 presets available, or create your own scheme
  * Color scheme saved in TR EEPROM for recollection  after power down/reboot
  * Some general color consolidation/standardization so all are customizable
* Very Large CRT file support: (Beta)
  * Example files in this category "A Pig Quest", "Eye of the Beholder" and "SNK vs Capcom"
  * CRT Files >850Kb employ a bank swapping from SD card (only) mechanism
    * First 850Kb stored in TR RAM as usual, remainder are marked for swapping
    * Uses the DMA signal to halt the CPU for ~3mS during an un-cached bank swap.
      * No actual DMA (bus mastering) takes place
    * Swaps are fast and typically only take place during "scene changes" in games.
      * Should be imperceptible to user experience.
  * 8ea 8K bank RAM cache with lookup to re-use already cached banks without pausing
  * Uses "old school" REU type of DMA assertion for fast pausing and no additional CPU execution
    * Not reliable on some systems (Most C128s and a low percentage of NTSC systems)
    * DMA Pause check utility included in Test+Diags dir to test specific system DMA reliability
      * Written in BASIC with test hooks in TR BASIC commands IO Handler
  * Many large CRT files have been tested with this scheme, all are working smoothly (as long as host C64 passes DMA check)
  * File sizes of <850KB continue to work as they do today, all served directly out of RAM.
  * See full CRT implementation details [here](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/CRT_Implementation.md).

  * Fix: Start/Stop Message Tokens used incorrect addressing
* Serial/Remote interface:
  * GetDirectoryCommand now checks for directory existence and returns error codes for specific issues.
  * GetFileCommand now checks for storage availability and returns error codes for specific issues.

### 0.6.5 Release 2025/01/20
* NFC Loading System updates:
  * Support for **"Mifare Classic 1k"** NFC tags
    * No pre-formatting required, usable as received.
    * Tags of this type are often included with NFC reader module purchases
    * As with "Ultralight" (NTAG213/215/216) tags, "Classic 1k" tags can be written from a phone or the TeensyROM itself
  * Bug Fix: Reset tag re-use timer *after* launch in case random dir takes a long time
    * Random tags occasionally caused repeated random load/run loop.
    * Thanks @Falcon for the find/testing
* Program (PRG) loader and BASIC filesystem
  * Setting current device number to 8 so that file browsers will point at IEC for dir read, etc
  * Load function key vector if JiffyDOS Kernal is present
  * Main menu /Utilities directory updates/additions:
    * "Exit to BASIC" for NFC taggable method to enter BASIC
    * "TeensyROM Menu Cart..." for NFC taggable method to enter TR menu
  * Thank you to @Boris Schneider-Johne for all the recommendations/support/testing on these items!
  
### 0.6.4 Release 2025/01/03
* NFC Loading System updates:
  * NFC Random selection from a specified directory:
    * "?" to write tag for random via currently selected directory (in TR, SD, or USB)
    * Recommend using random with directories containing <100 items. Function must load full directory to pick one at random, so large directories will take longer to pick/launch from.  
    * Thanks to @distressed74  @Avrilcadabra  @Makers Mashup  @AndyDavis @William Manganaro for the thoughts/feedback
  * Can now re-scan/launch same NFC tag as previously scanned, if it is away from the reader for >1 full second
    * Allowance to enable re-use of same "random" tag repeatedly
* MIDI/ASID updates:
  * Fix for SIDWizzard "Jam Mode" (tracker playback simultaneous w/ MIDI enabled/receiving)
    * No longer setting StatusIRQReq bit on MIDI out msgs
    * Thanks to @DivertigO for identifying/testing
  * New ASID commands parsed and parameters/values displayed (but not yet applied)
* Emulation/loading improvements:
  * GMod2 .CRT support (Bank switching only)
    * Thanks for the prompt @Mike351 and sorted CRT files @AmokPhaze101 
  * Clear cart signature from $8004 of RAM if present (Thanks Artur Rataj for the info/recommendation)
    * malicious setting written by some games (ie "Hero") that can stay resident and prevent restarts
* Autolaunch improvements for diagnostic use:
  * Autolaunch capability from SD file: /autolaunch.txt
    * Example autolaunch.txt file with instructions added to /docs directory
    * Takes priority over EEPROM set autolaunch, when enabled
    * This is a means to enable diagnostics autolaunch *without* a functional C64
  * Autolaunch now launches CRTs without booting to TR menu first
    * Allows diagnostics booting *without* full C64 functionality.
    * For example, can Autolaunch DesTestMax on a C64 with missing RAM chips!
  * Thanks for the ideas/input Factor of Matt (https://factorofmatt.com/)
* Bus Snoop (new feature):
  * Serial 'b' command to snoop bus (Addr, Data, R/nW) to insure all bits toggle (Debug tool)
    * Monitors 100,000 bus cycles and reads the Address & Data bus to log the state of each bit and sends a summary out the USB Serial port.  
    * This will help identify "stuck bits" on the bus, a failure that won't allow any thing to run/display, and is hard to narrow down without an oscilloscope and a block of time.
  * In the future, this feature can grow into a detailed bus analyzer with buffer/filters, or monitor the bus for SID writes to do visualizations and other SID logging/recording. Lots of possibilities...
* HW Fab 0.3 preparation
  * Disallow FW downgrade below this version for Fab 0.3 PCBs
  * Determines HW Fab # based on Dot-Clk read routine
* Timing/compatibility improvement:
  * New timing param: nS_VICDHold (365nS Default), separated out from nS_DataHold (non-VIC cycle)
  * nS_DataHold (non-vic hold) increased from 365 to 390nS
    * To accommodate Mega65 and Reloaded Mk II by default without special FW needed
    * Lots of validation testing done to ensure cross compatibility.  Thanks for all the help @DigitalMan
  * RW Ready Delay on by default in EEPROM (this FW resets EEPROM to defaults)
* Aesthetic/information only:
  * Bottom of settings menu changed to git URL from Travis/Sensorium
  * C64 Splash screen updated to 2025
  * Deprecated old Form based Win App
  * Removed #define nfcScanner (now permanent part of build)
  * Doc/help screen updates for NFC random tag

### 0.6.1 Release 2024/09/16
* ASID Player usage documentation created, [available here](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/ASID_Player.md)
* ASID player updates (v1.1)
  * Added customized character set  to make indicators round, bar graph characters, and dot for zero value on spinners
  * Beta feature added:  Frame timer to re-time ASID playback for timing improvement
    * Usage documented in ASID Player doc linked above
    * Commands added to enable/disable timer and set buffer size
    * Micro timing adjustments of no more than 1uS per 12 frames to keep buffer primed but not overflowed
    * Buffer fill level displayed on screen
    * 50Hz 1x and Auto modes selectable
      * In auto mode, the playback interval will be measured at beginning and used as a seed time for the rest of the playback.
        * This method works fairly well, but is dependent on USB packet intervals which are occasionally a bit off (thus the need for the timer). 
        * In the future, DeepSID (and perhaps others) will provide a "recipe" packet to specify the exact interval and eliminate the need to time the packets and improve seed accuracy.
          * DeepSID uses Web MIDI, which appears to have the worst jitter. SID Factory II, ASIDXP, and SIDPlay are *much* better
        * 1x and 2x speed SIDs (PAL or NTSC) play reliably, 4x usually has a couple small packet errors during the full song, but typically not audibly detectable.  
        * Above 4x and other asynchronous formats don't do well with the frame timer. Leave it "off" for these
      * 50Hz 1x mode works best for SIDs of that speed and seed the timer with an exact value regardless of timed value
    * Thank you to @hExx, @Avrilcadabra, @tubesockor, @iZero, and @Slaygon for you testing/feedback/ideas around this feature!
* MIDI2SID Freq calc corrected for PAL/NTSC 
  * Based on system typed detected
  * Thank you @Avrilcadabra for the prompt

  * Return to main menu by pushing the button on the TeensyROM
  * Build instructions created for full dual-boot hex file creation
